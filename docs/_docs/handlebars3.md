In the `public` dir we need to keep the images and `css` files.

**NOTE**: The front-end is made using bootstrap(don't hesitate whenever you see stylesheet files from bootstrap).

{: .unreleased .note}
**public css**<br>file path: `./public/styles.css`

```html
.cursive-text-large{
 font-family: lobster-two, cursive;
 font-size: 40px;
}

.cursive-text-small{
 font-family: lobster-two, cursive;
 font-size: 20px;
}
```
These classes (`cursive-text-large` and `cursive-text-small`) are being used in our `handlebars` files.

You also need to add images in your `public` dir. The images are the being used in the `routes.js` file.

Now lets see the main file (app.js):

{: .unreleased .note}
**partials code**<br>file path: `./public/styles.css`

```html

```
