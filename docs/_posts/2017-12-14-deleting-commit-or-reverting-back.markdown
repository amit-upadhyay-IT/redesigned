**Do you still have a habit of writing the Java programs in old fashion?** It's okay if you have, but I would suggest you become modern with `Java8`. You must be knowing that `Java8` came with the concept of `lambdas` and `stream APIs` and these things have been introduced long before.

Thank you 👏
