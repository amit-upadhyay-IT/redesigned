### Classes

It is basically a blueprint to create objects. An object is a basic key concept of OOP but classes provide an ability to generalize similar type of objects.


### Object

**Every object is characterised by**:

- **Identity**: This is the name that identifies an object.

- **Properties**: These are the features or attributes of the object.

- **Behaviour**: The behaviour of an object signifies what all functions an object can perform.
